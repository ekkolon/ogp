# Open Graph Protocol for the Rust eco-system

This Rust library provides a set of utilities, validators, and error handling mechanisms for working with the Open Graph Protocol (OGP). The OGP is a set of conventions used to mark up web content, facilitating easy sharing on social media platforms. By specifying metadata, including object types, titles, descriptions, and images, content can be displayed more effectively when shared on platforms like X, Facebook or LinkedIn.
