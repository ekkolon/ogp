[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ekkolon/ogp/graph/badge.svg?token=7CI720UB3J)](https://codecov.io/gh/ekkolon/ogp)

This Rust library is designed to streamline working with the Open Graph Protocol (OGP) by offering a comprehensive suite of utilities, validators, and error-handling mechanisms.

The OGP serves as a set of conventions for annotating web content to facilitate content sharing across various social media platforms.

By precisely defining metadata, encompassing object types, titles, descriptions, and images, content becomes more visually compelling when shared on platforms such as X, Facebook, or LinkedIn.
